    <p class="content">My name is Mohit and I am a student of science. I hold a bachelor's degree in Civil Engineering and a master's degree in Mechanical Engineering. Currently, I am pursuing PhD from Arizona State University with research focus on Computer Vision and Machine Learning. I am being advised by <a href="https://thomasczerniawski.com/">Dr. Thomas Czerniawski</a>, <a href="https://ssebe.engineering.asu.edu/">SSEBE</a> , ASU.</p>
    <p class="content">Before starting PhD in Fall 2021, I worked for about 6 years in both private and public sectors in India. I started as a BIM Engineer, then an Educator (for an Indian competitive exam called GATE, in which I scored an All India Rank of 88 out of 153000+ candidates) , then a Nuclear scientist (very different, I know) and finally as a Grade-A Officer in a government enterprise. </p>
