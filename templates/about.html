      I am Mohit, a Ph.D. candidate in the Sustainable School of Engineering & the Built Environment (SSEBE) at Arizona State University. 
      My PhD research uses computer vision to digitize images of engineering blueprints and leverages Natural Language Processing to design a Question-Answering mechanism to automate manual process of design review and compliance process.<br> 
      During Ph.D., I got opportunities to work with researchers from Stanford University (US), TU Munich (Germany) and EPFL (Switzerland) on research projects related to video analysis with CNNs & LSTMs, 3D reconstruction with deep-learning based methods like Neural Radiance Fields.<br>
      I also worked with indutry partners such as Salt River Project for IoT based condition monitoring of assets, Sundt Construction for Document Digitization, Penta Building Group for building a LLM-based chatbot based on historical data of construction projects.<br>
      Both the research and industry projects provided me with a unique opportunity to work on real-world problems and develop solutions that can be applied in practice.<br>
      This motivated me to even launch a start-up called Street Counts, a PaaS (Platform as a Service) company providing computer vision-based Traffic Management solutions to cities and municipalities (and raised about ~ $135k in seed grants).<br>

      <!-- These end-to-end solutions go beyond training AI models. I address challenges such as:<br> 
      (i) Negligible or sparsely annotated data,<br> 
      (ii) Lack of standardization,<br>
      (iii) AI models being 'black-box' systems.<br>
      <br> -->
      
      <!-- Areas of expertise:<br> 
      (i) Object detection & Tracking<br> 
      (ii) Semi-supervised ,<br>
      (iii) AI models being 'black-box' systems.<br>
      <br> -->
      <!-- These are critical issues preventing not only building robust AI models but adversely impacts their integration with the AECO industry, a high-risk & low-margin industry. -->
