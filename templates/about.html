    <p class="content">My name is Mohit and I am a PhD student in Civil and Environmental Engineering at Arizona State University. I am being advised by <a href="https://thomasczerniawski.com/">Dr. Thomas Czerniawski</a> and <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=P-JYh4MAAAAJ&hl=en">Dr. Ricardo Eiris</a>. I am conducting interdisciplinary research that bridges computer vision and the AEC industry. In my past works, I developed algorithms for processing engineering drawings to automate their digitization, configured a method to link neural network outputs to a 3D modeling software, investigated the trade-off between accuracy and data storage requirements by implementing different 3D reconstruction techniques as opposed to Lidar scans; and also built an LLM-based app for a construction company to assist in document control. </p>
    <p class="content"> I am currently trying to develop a method to monitor the condition of road infrastructure and non-motorist traffic flow in a cheaper and smarter way.</p>
    <p class="content"> <strong>A brief history about me:</strong> Before starting PhD in the Fall 2021, I worked in India for about 6 years in both private and public sectors. Professionally, I took many roles - a BIM Engineer; an Educator; a Nuclear scientist (very interesting, I know), and a Grade-A Officer in a government enterprise. And, I enjoyed all of them.</p>
