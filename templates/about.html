      <p>ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I'm <b>Mohit</b>, a Ph.D. candidate in the <i>Sustainable School of Engineering & the Built Environment (SSEBE)</i> at <b>Arizona State University</b>.</p>

      <p>
        My research focuses on building Applied AI solutions for various applications in AEC industry.
        One such application that was central to my Ph.D. involved using Computer Vision to digitize engineering blueprints and NLP to develop a 
        question-answering system to (partially) automate tasks like design review and code compliance. Other applications that I have built in collaboration with
        industry partners or in my previous jobs include an IoT-based condition monitoring app and data visualization dashboard, LLM-powered chatbot trained on
        historical construction project data, and document digitization.
      </p>

      <p>
        I have also been very lucky to have collaborated with researchers from <b>Stanford University</b> (USA), <b>TU Munich</b> (Germany), and <b>EPFL</b> (Switzerland)
        on projects involving CNNs and LSTMs for video analysis, and NeRF and SfM for 3D reconstruction.
      </p>
<!-- 
      <p>
        Motivated by impact, I worked with industry partners such as Salt River Project on <b>IoT-based condition monitoring</b>,
        Sundt Construction on <b>document digitization</b>, and Penta Building Group on developing an <b>LLM-powered chatbot</b> trained on
        historical construction project data.
      </p> -->
<!-- 
      <p>
        âš¡ These research and industry engagements gave me the opportunity to solve <i>real-world problems</i> with direct practical value.
        This inspired me to launch <b>Street Counts</b>, a PaaS startup that provides <b>computer vision-based traffic management</b> 
        solutions for cities and municipalities.

      <p>
      Currently, I am working closely with <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=cvqNuosAAAAJ&hl=en">Dr. Deborah Salon</a> on urban mobility and sustainability.

      In past, I worked with <a href="https://thomasczerniawski.com/">Dr. Thomas Czerniawski</a> and <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=P-JYh4MAAAAJ&hl=en">Dr. Ricardo Eiris</a> on 3D reconstruction and point cloud segmentation.
