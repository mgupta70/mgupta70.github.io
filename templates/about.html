    <p class="content">My name is Mohit and I am a student of science. I hold a bacehlor's degree in Civil Engineering and master's degree in Mechanical Engineering. Now, I am pursuing PhD from ASU with research focus on Computer Vision. I am being supervised by <a href="https://thomasczerniawski.com/">Dr. Thomas Czerniawski</a>, <a href="https://ssebe.engineering.asu.edu/">SSEBE</a> , ASU.LearningML  second-year PhD student in the School of Sustainable Engineering and Built Environment at Arizona State University. Prior to this, I spent 2 years in the amazing city of Barcelona working as a Researcher at the Perception and Manipulation group. I was a Research Assistant at <a href="https://www.iri.upc.edu/">Institut de Robotica Informatica, (UPC-CSIC)</a> advised by <a href="http://www.iri.upc.edu/people/fmoreno/">Prof. Francesc Moreno-Nogeur</a>  and <a href="https://www.iri.upc.edu/people/mdimiccoli/">Prof. Mariella Dimiccoli</a>.</p>
    <p class="content"> My recent research focus has been developing novel approaches for 3D person pose estimation and reconstruction. Specifically, I’m working on using self supervised learning and leveraing cues from our multi view dataset to improve the Egocentric 3D Human pose estimations.</p>
    <p class="content"> Before I joined IRI, I heavily worked on Systems. I was a Software Developer at <a href="http://www.tescobengaluru.com/">Tesco Technology</a> for a year. I graduated with a B.Eng. in Electrical and Electronics from <a href="https://www.bits-pilani.ac.in/pilani/">Birla Institute of Technology and Science, Pilani</a>. In my final year, I was a Research Assistant at the Cognitive Computing Group in <a href="https://www.ceeri.res.in/">Central Electronics Engineering Research Institute (CSIR-CEERI)</a>. I was advised by <a href="https://www.ceeri.res.in/profiles/sanjay-singh/">Dr. Sanjay Singh</a>, and we worked on improving signature verification for low power devices.
