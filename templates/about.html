    <p class="content">My name is Mohit and I am a PhD student in Sustainable School of Engineering & Built Environment at Arizona State University. I am being advised by <a href="https://thomasczerniawski.com/">Dr. Thomas Czerniawski</a> and <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=P-JYh4MAAAAJ&hl=en">Dr. Ricardo Eiris</a>. </p>
    <p class="content"> I am currently working on empirical modeling and predictive analytics to optimize maintenance time-cycles for large machinery like turbines. It involves developing temporal decay models quantifying the state of the machinery and using historical data to put in place contextual anomaly detection models to avoid sudden failures.</p>
<!--     <p class="content"> <strong>A brief history about me:</strong> Before starting PhD in the Fall 2021, I worked in India for about 6 years in both private and public sectors. Professionally, I took many roles - a BIM Engineer; an Educator; a Nuclear scientist (very interesting, I know), and a Grade-A Officer in a government enterprise. And, I enjoyed all of them.</p>
