    <p class="content">My name is Mohit and I am a PhD student in Civil and Environmental Engineering at Arizona State University. I am being advised by <a href="https://thomasczerniawski.com/">Dr. Thomas Czerniawski</a> , ASU. My research explores the magic which happens at the intersection of Construction and AI. In my past works, I developed algorithms for processing P&ID drawings, converting NN outputs into 3D BIM models, explored 3D reconstructions from 360&deg; video imagery and also built LLM-based apps for a construction company to assist in document control. </p>
    <p class="content"> I am currently working to build smart and cheap street cameras for bicyclist counting in the city of Tempe. I am developing a person (or rather bicycist) re-identification algorithm across images taken by motion-sensitive camera traps. </p>
    <p class="content"> <strong>A brief history about me:</strong> Before starting PhD in Fall 2021, I worked for about 6 years in both private and public sectors in India. I started as a BIM Engineer, then an educator (for an Indian competitive exam called GATE, in which I scored an All India Rank of 88 out of 153000+ candidates) , then a Nuclear scientist (very different, I know) and finally as a Grade-A Officer in a government enterprise. During my time in industry, I felt there are so many pockets of improvement in our construction industry which can only be filled by automation. Hence, I decided to go for a PhD. </p>
