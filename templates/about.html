    <p class="content"> ðŸ‘‹ My name is Mohit, and I am a Ph.D. student conducting interdisciplinary research between computer vision and construction technology at Arizona State University. I am being advised by <a href="https://thomasczerniawski.com/">Dr. Thomas Czerniawski</a> and  <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=P-JYh4MAAAAJ&hl=en/">Dr. Ricardo Eiris</a>.  </p>
    <p class="content"> I am currently working on building smart <u>(and cheap)</u> street cameras for bicyclist counting. I am exploring the deployment of ML models on small, low-power devices. For my past research works in self-supervised learning and 3D reconstruction please refer below. </p>
<!--     <p class="content"> <strong>A brief history about me:</strong> Before starting PhD in Fall 2021, I worked for about 6 years in both private and public sectors in India. I started as a BIM Engineer, then an educator (for an Indian competitive exam called GATE, in which I scored an All India Rank of 88 out of 153000+ candidates) , then a Nuclear scientist (very different, I know) and finally as a Grade-A Officer in a government enterprise. During my time in industry, I felt there are so many pockets of improvement in our construction industry which can be filled only by automation. Hence, I decided to go for a PhD. </p> -->
