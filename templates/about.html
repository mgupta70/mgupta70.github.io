    <p class="content">Hola! My name is Mohit and I am a student of science. I hold a bacehlor's degree in Civil Engineering and a master's degree in Mechanical Engineering. Now, I am pursuing PhD from ASU with research focus on Computer Vision. I am being supervised by <a href="https://thomasczerniawski.com/">Dr. Thomas Czerniawski</a>, <a href="https://ssebe.engineering.asu.edu/">SSEBE</a> , ASU.</p>
    <p class="content">Before starting PhD in Fall 2021, I worked for about 6 years in India assuming different roles such as BIM Engineer, educator (for an Indian competitive exam called GATE, in which I scored an All India Rank of 88 out of 153000 candidates) , nuclear scientist (very different, I know) and finally as a Grade-A officer in a Public Sector Undertakings. </p>
