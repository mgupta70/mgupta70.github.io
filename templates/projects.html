       <p> Developed anomaly detection & time-series forecasting models to monitor vibrations in dam turbines for the safe operation. 
        The project is aimed to shift from costly reactive/preventive maintenance to more efficient predicitive maintenance using the operational history of the asset.
        However, the biggest challenge was the absence of 'faulty' vibration data as most of the time, turbine was operated in normal (safe) working condition.
        To solve this, I engaged with field engineers to understand the data and integrate domain knowledge to buid a model for estimating <del> vibration at any time t in future</del> <b>rate of change of vibration</b>. </p>

        <p>Typically, P&IDs would have 100's of symbols depicting equipments like valves, compressors, piping components, etc. Manually labelling the dataset is a challenging task due to (i) large number of classesm (ii) many symbols resemble a lot with one another causing confusion while annotating and (iii) non-standardized drawing layouts. Hence, a symbol detection pipleline with class agnostic detection & self-supervised symbol classification is proposed that achieved a Top-5 accuracy of 95.49% over 102 test classes.</p>

        <p> Capturing a scene with Lidar inherently needs a large amount of data storage. So, in this study, I investigated an alternative approach to capture the 3D information via 360 videos. I particularly used Structure-from-Motion (SfM) and Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) for the task of 3D reconstruction. These techniques provide significant savings in terms of data storage requirements but there is a trade-off with dimensional accuracy. Please refer the Results section in the attached paper for quantitative results. 
          Since construction sites are not always well-lit, NeRF didn't perform quite well for the objects that were far and poorly lit. However, areas which are well-lit, 3D reconstruction by NeRF and SfM were almost same.
          In my view, the selection of appropriate technology would be driven by its use case. For ex: for a simple task of visualization, SfM method could be preferred but if one needs precise measurement (of tiny or thin objects) then Lidar would be the choice.</p>

        <p>  Aim of this project is to speed up the conversion of a 2D CAD into a 3D BIM model. We found that the semantic segmentation-based approach is more performant than the typical bounding-based methods. In post-processing, we configured the linkage of neural network outputs to a 3D drafting software via Dynamo API.</p>
