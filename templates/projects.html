        <br>
        <p> Capturing a scene with Lidar requires a large amount of data storage. So, in this study, I investigated the accuracy of 360 videos to reconstruct the entire site using SfM and Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF). These techniques provide significant savings in data storage requirements but there is a trade-off with spatial accuracy. The selection of appropriate technology would be driven by its use case. For a simple task of visualization, SfM could be preferred but if one needs precise measurement then there is nothing more accurate than Lidar..</p>

        <br>
        <p>Typically, P&IDs would have 100's of symbols depicting various equipment. Labelling more than 200 classes of symbols is a challenging task especially when some of them resemble a lot with one another. Hence, to reduce the annotation load, I used self-supervised contrastive learning and built a semi-supervised pipeline for symbol detection.<br> The method a Top-1 accuracy of 85.49% over 102 classes.</p>

        <br>
        <p>  Aim of this project is to speed up the conversion of 2D CAD into a 3D BIM model. We found that semantic segmentation-based approach is more performant than the typical bounding-based methods. In post-processing, we configured the linkage of neural network outputs to a 3D drafting software via Dynamo API.</p>

        <br>
        <p>Devised a synthetic data generation pipeline to create a labeled dataset without any human annotations. Experimentation revealed that the presence of look-alike symbols (i.e. hard negatives) helped in reducing false positives & increased the performance.</p>
