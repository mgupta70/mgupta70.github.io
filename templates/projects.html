        <h3 class="content_heading">Semi-supervised symbols detection in Piping and Instrumentation Drawings</h3>
        <br>
        <p>Developed a Siamese Network for symbol retrieval and applied K-means coreset sampling to achieve nearly the same performance as using the full dataset, but with only 30% of the data.<br> Improved the Top-1 accuracy by 4.5% with Ensemble learning.</p>

        <br>
        <p>  Trained a Yolov3 model to recognize building components in 2D CAD. Then, linked the localised coordinates with Dynamo to create 3D model in Revit.</p>

        <br>
        <p>Devised a synthetic-data generation pipeline to create a labelled dataset without any human annotations. Presence of a look-alike symbols (i.e. hard negatives) reduced false positives & increased the performance.</p>
